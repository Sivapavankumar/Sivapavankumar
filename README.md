### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Siva Pavan Kumar Chava from Ongole, Andhra pradesh, India.

I have completed my Bachelor's in 2022 from BIHER, Chennai.

I'm currently in USA for my masters degree in applied computer science at Northwest Missouri State University.

I love playing cricket and always wanted to become a cricketer. I play cricket to stay active and relieve tension. Since I was a little child, I have been a huge follower of MS Dhoni, which has led to cricket being my favorite sport.

I can be reached on instgram at pavanbalayya_0209.
